# Decentralized Microfinance Platform

## Overview

This decentralized microfinance platform leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize financial inclusion, providing transparent, secure, and efficient microloans to underserved communities worldwide. By implementing smart contracts for loan applications, group guarantees, repayment tracking, and credit history building, this platform eliminates traditional barriers to financial services while creating sustainable, community-driven economic development opportunities.
